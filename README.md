### Resources
Your repository should include the following:

- Python script for your analysis
- Results figure/saved file
- Dockerfile for your experiment
- runtime-instructions in a file named RUNME.md

## Research Question

1 sentence description of your research question.

### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

- opportunity (what data do we have)
- challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
- action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
- resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:
